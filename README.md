# Cookit! KTOR

---

## Introduction

A fork of the Cookit! app being built to use KTOR and kotlinx serialization.

### Some current features of the app

* Search for recipes pulled from [TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php)
* Users can store their own recipes privately.
  * Uses Google's Firebase Firestore
* Users can store images of meals or the process of cooking them.
  * Uses a combination of Firestore and Storage

### Possible changes beyond KTOR and kotlinx serialization

* Implement a different solution for user recipe storage
* TODO
